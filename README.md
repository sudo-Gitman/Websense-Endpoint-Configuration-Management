# Websense-Endpoint-Configuration-Management
This repository contains a script to manage the configuration of Websense Endpoint services. The script is designed to back up the existing localconfig.xml configuration file, replace it with a predefined configuration, and restart Websense services. It also includes mechanisms to disable and enable anti-tampering during the operation.
